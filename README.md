# Stock Price Analysis Using Autoregressive and Moving Average Models

## 📖 Introduction
Stock prices are influenced by their historical behavior and random market fluctuations. Traditional analysis methods often fail to capture these time-dependent patterns. This project applies classical time series techniques, namely **Autoregressive (AR)** and **Moving Average (MA)** models, to study and model short-term stock price movements.

The project demonstrates how past values and past errors can be used to explain and forecast stock price behavior.
